# Browser data extension (BrD-ext/)
Browser extension to get relevant browser data like counts with a helpful display using extension badges and a popup.


## What it shows
- Tab count -> Number of tabs ope across all windows
- Window count -> Number of windows open in browser
- Current window tabs count - Number of tabs in the current window
- Inactive tabs -> Number of inactive tabs
- Bookmarks -> Total number of saved bookmarks

<!-- 
    Inactive tab count
    Age of current tab, 
    current window pinned tabs 
-->

*If incognito access granted*
- Incognito tab count 
- Incognito window count


## Instalation
1. Download the browser-data-extension folder, 
2. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and go to developer mode. <!-- only for chrome but maybe edge and firefox too -->
3. Click `Load unpacked` and select the extension folder. <!-- Maybe add image? -->
4. Get insights on browser productivity data.


## Future features
- Open to more browsers
- Bookmark folder breakdown
- Tab grouping insights -> (each group and number of tabs, age)


## Reasoning
The extension is an effort to force myself to understand chrome apis and cross browser functionality by using other contexts.

I also wish to maybe publish it and get a little manageable application on the market to watch it and handle its real-world management and testing.
